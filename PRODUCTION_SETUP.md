# üè¶ Production Setup Guide - Connect Real Banks

## üéØ Current Status
‚úÖ **Sandbox API**: Working perfectly  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Production API**: Requires additional setup

## üìã Steps to Enable Real Bank Connections

### 1. **Apply for Production Access**
Go to your Plaid Dashboard:
- Visit: https://dashboard.plaid.com/
- Login with your Plaid account
- Click **"Request Production Access"**

### 2. **Complete Application**
Plaid will ask for:
- **Use Case**: "Personal Finance Management"
- **App Description**: "MoneyMage - Personal transaction automation"
- **Expected Volume**: "Personal use, ~3 bank accounts"
- **Company Info**: Your personal details

### 3. **Get Production Credentials**
Once approved, you'll receive:
- **Production Client ID** (different from sandbox)
- **Production Secret** (different from sandbox)
- **Production Environment** access

### 4. **Update Configuration**
Replace in `plaid_config.json`:
```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID",
  "secret": "YOUR_PRODUCTION_SECRET",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## üöÄ **Alternative: Quick Production Test**

### Option A: Use Sandbox for Full System Test
Since your sandbox API works perfectly, we can:
1. ‚úÖ **Test the entire automation system** with sandbox
2. ‚úÖ **Integrate with your daily scheduler** 
3. ‚úÖ **Verify all components work**
4. ‚úÖ **Apply for production when ready**

### Option B: Start with CSV + Scheduler Now
We can combine approaches:
1. **Daily scheduler** continues with your CSV downloads
2. **Plaid integration** ready for when production is approved
3. **Gradual migration** from CSV to API

## üéØ **Recommended Next Steps**

### **Today: Complete the Automation**
1. **Test scheduler** with your existing CSV files
2. **Integrate Plaid** when production is ready
3. **Best of both worlds!**

### **This Week: Apply for Production**
1. Submit Plaid production application
2. Usually approved within 1-2 business days
3. Personal use applications are typically fast-tracked

## üîß **Ready to Proceed?**

**Option 1**: Apply for production access now (1-2 days wait)
**Option 2**: Complete automation with CSV + add Plaid later
**Option 3**: Test everything in sandbox first
