## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Import Issues
- **Problem**: Transactions aren't importing
  - **Solution**: Check file paths in `get_new_transactions()` and ensure CSV files match expected patterns

- **Problem**: Duplicate transactions
  - **Solution**: The system should detect duplicates automatically. If issues persist, check the duplicate detection logic in `update_old_transactions()`

### Budget Calculation Issues
- **Problem**: Category totals don't match transactions
  - **Solution**: Check reconciliation status ('R' column) and ensure all transactions are correctly categorized

- **Problem**: Projection looks incorrect
  - **Solution**: Verify your account balances are correct in the "Balances" sheet

### Excel File Corruption
- **Problem**: Excel file won't open or is corrupted
  - **Solution**: Restore from a backup in the `archive/` folder
  - **Prevention**: Always let the script finish completely before opening Excel files

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Consistent Categorization**: Use consistent categories for all transactions to ensure accurate reporting

2. **Regular Updates**: Import transactions weekly to keep your projections accurate

3. **Reconciliation**: Mark transactions as reconciled once verified to prevent them from being included in future projections

4. **Budget Planning**: Use the "Projection" sheet to identify potential cash flow issues months in advance

5. **Category Types**: Choose the appropriate category type based on expense frequency:
   - Monthly: Regular monthly expenses (groceries, utilities)
   - Quarterly: Expenses occurring every 3 months
   - Yearly: Annual expenses (insurance, memberships)
   - Loan: Fixed payment schedules (mortgage, car payment)

6. **Account Structure**: Consider using separate accounts for different purposes (e.g., bills, discretionary spending, savings) to simplify tracking
